'next' and 'prev' class makes the incoming slide positioned absolute, so it can follow outgoing slide\n *\n * To slide right to left we have to:\n * - add class 'active', 'next', and right to the next slide\n * - add class 'left' on the current slide same time as remove the 'right' class on the incoming one\n * - remove all classes and only leave 'active' on the incoming slide\n *\n */\n\nvar DIRECTION = {\n    rtl: {\n        outgoing: 'left',\n        incoming: 'right',\n        overlay: 'next'\n    },\n    ltr: {\n        outgoing: 'right',\n        incoming: 'left',\n        overlay: 'prev'\n    }\n};\n\nexports.default = {\n    replace: true,\n    computed: {},\n    data: function data() {\n        return {\n            index: 0,\n            slidesCount: 0,\n            animating: false,\n            slides: [],\n            direction: DIRECTION.rtl\n        };\n    },\n\n    props: {\n        interval: {\n            type: Number,\n            default: 5000\n        },\n        indicators: {\n            type: Boolean,\n            default: true\n        },\n        controls: {\n            type: Boolean,\n            default: true\n        }\n    },\n    methods: {\n        // previous slide\n        prev: function prev() {\n            if (this.animating) {\n                return;\n            }\n            this.index--;\n            if (this.index < 0) {\n                this.index = this.slidesCount;\n            }\n        },\n\n        // next slide\n        next: function next() {\n            if (this.animating) {\n                return;\n            }\n            this.index++;\n            if (this.index > this.slidesCount) {\n                this.index = 0;\n            }\n        },\n\n        // on slide change\n        changeSlide: function changeSlide(index) {\n            this.index = index;\n        },\n\n        // pause auto rotation\n        pause: function pause() {\n            if (this.interval === 0 || typeof this.interval === 'undefined') {\n                return;\n            }\n            clearInterval(this._intervalId);\n        },\n\n        // start auto rotate slides\n        start: function start() {\n            var _this = this;\n\n            if (this.interval === 0 || typeof this.interval === 'undefined') {\n                return;\n            }\n            this._intervalId = setInterval(function () {\n                _this.next();\n            }, this.interval);\n        }\n    },\n    mounted: function mounted() {\n        // get all slides\n        this._items = this.$el.querySelectorAll('.carousel-item');\n        this.slidesCount = this._items.length -

B4 deliberately dropped support for this.\n * - It is not accessible.\n *\n * How it works:\n * - active element applies the transition to the slide but not triggers it\n * - we need to use 'right' and 'left' classes to trigger animation\n * - 'next' and 'prev' class makes the incoming slide positioned absolute, so it can follow outgoing slide\n *\n * To slide right to left we have to:\n * - add class 'active', 'next', and right to the next slide\n * - add class 'left' on the current slide same time as remove the 'right' class on the incoming one\n * - remove all classes and only leave 'active' on the incoming slide\n *\n */\n\nimport {csstransitions} from '../utils/helpers';\n\n// this is directly linked to the bootstrap animation timing in _carousel.scss\n// for browsers that do
